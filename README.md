# Waterfall-and-v-model-testing-project
# Project Description

This project is a comparative analysis of two widely used software development and testing models: the Waterfall Model and the V-Model (Verification and Validation Model). The focus is on understanding how each model structures the development and testing phases, highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, and practical applications.

Through detailed documentation, the project demonstrates how each model can be implemented in different scenariosâ€”such as an offline student result management system for the Waterfall Model and an online flight booking system for the V-Model. By designing test cases, flowcharts, and bug reports, the project showcases manual testing skills while analyzing the effectiveness and efficiency of both approaches. This study aims to provide insights into which model best fits different project requirements in terms of complexity, scope, and testing involvement.
